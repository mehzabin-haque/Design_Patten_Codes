# Design Pattern Code

This folder contains the implementation of various design patterns, including creational, structural, and behavioral patterns, in different programming languages. Each design pattern has its own code file, providing a comprehensive collection for learning and reference purposes.

----
## Creational Patterns:

### Factory Method: 
  Implements the Factory Method pattern, which defines an interface for creating objects, but allows subclasses to decide which class to instantiate.

### Factory Pattern: 
  Demonstrates the Factory pattern, where a factory class is responsible for creating objects based on a specified input or condition.

### Abstract Factory: 
  Implements the Abstract Factory pattern, which provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

### Builder: 
  Demonstrates the Builder pattern, where a builder class is used to construct complex objects step by step.

---- 
## Structural Patterns:

### Composite: 
  Implements the Composite pattern, where objects are structured into a tree-like hierarchy, allowing clients to treat individual objects and groups of objects uniformly.

### Decorator: 
  Demonstrates the Decorator pattern, which dynamically adds responsibilities to an object by wrapping it in a decorator class.

----
## Behavioral Patterns:

### Chain of Responsibility: 
  Implements the Chain of Responsibility pattern, where a series of handlers are used to process a request, with each handler having the ability to either handle the request or pass it to the next handler in the chain.

### Mediator: 
  Demonstrates the Mediator pattern, which defines an object that encapsulates communication between a set of objects, promoting loose coupling.

### Observer: 
  Implements the Observer pattern, where objects (observers) are notified and updated automatically when the state of another object (subject) changes.

### Strategy: 
Demonstrates the Strategy pattern, where different algorithms or strategies can be encapsulated and used interchangeably within an object.

### Template: 
Implements the Template pattern, which defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class, with subclasses implementing specific steps of the algorithm.

----
This comprehensive collection of design pattern code provides valuable resources for understanding and implementing these patterns in various software projects, promoting code reusability, flexibility, and maintainability.
